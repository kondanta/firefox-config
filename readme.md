## Note
This repository is not meant to be used as a whole, but rather as a reference for my own configuration. I do not recommend using it as is, as it is not meant to be used by anyone else. I do not provide any support for this repository. If you want to use it, you are on your own.

I recommend using a Firefox account and sync everything. Make sure to disable telemetry (all telemetry actually) in the settings ;)

## Where do each files go
| File      | Location    |
